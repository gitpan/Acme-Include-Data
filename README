1. ABOUT

Acme::Include::Data - it's easy to include data with a CPAN module

This is a demonstration module which demonstrates how to include a
data file with a Perl module and how to read it in at run time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. DOCUMENTATION

You can read the documentation for the module online at the following websites:

    * http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Acme::Include::Data
    * http://metacpan.org/release/Acme-Include-Data

(These links go to the latest version of the module.)

After installing the module, you can read the documentation on your computer
